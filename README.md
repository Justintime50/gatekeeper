# dir-walker
Easily walk through a directory and find what you need.

## Usage
- `file-ext-search.py` will search for PHP files in the directory it's placed and return what it finds.

## Roadmap
- Eventually allow searching of files or keywords we aren't interested in housing in a repo such as a catch-all gitignore or CDN entries etc.
